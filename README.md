# Game-Theory
Various pieces of code related to game theory.

## Specific Games
Implementations of solvers or related utilities for particular individual games or narrow families of games.

### Stochastic Nim
Classic one-pile Nim where moves are randomly augmented by taking an extra token.

## Combinatorial Game Theory
Generic code relating to [combinatorial games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory).

### General Solver
Given a function returning the set of states reachable from a given state, returns the set of optimal moves for a combinatorial game, at a particular state.
